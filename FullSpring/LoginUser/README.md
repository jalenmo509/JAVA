Build an application that requires both user authentication and validations
Add server-side validations in addition to model-level validations
Implement authentication logic
Use 'Optionals' to check if a user exists
Import and use 'BCrypt' to create hashes and compare hashed strings against the database
Use and manipulate transient member variables and non-entity classes
Handle user logout and active session status
Use session data to pull the current user's information
